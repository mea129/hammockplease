## Steps
**1. Find a place to set-up.**
**IMPORTANT: Survey the site for objects that may injure you if you fall out of the hammock.**
* Seek a well established site that doesn't cross any pathways.

**2. Select a pair of trees.**
* Identify two trees separated by 10 to 16 feet of open space.
* Select trees with healthy limbs and thick trunks (at least 6 inches in diameter).

**3. Inspect your gear.**
* Unravel the Legit Camping Double Hammock. Ensure you have two tree straps and one nylon bed with two attached steel carabiners. See Image A.
* Check the gear for snags, tears, or fraying. Discontinue if materials are compromised.

**4. Position the tree strap.**
* Wrap the first strap around the first tree at a height between 5 and 6 feet.
_Note: The strap-end on one side of the tree will have a knot. The strap-end on the opposite side will have a loop._

**5. Secure the tree strap.**
* Facing the tree, place the knotted end of the strap through the looped end.
* Pull the knot until the strap is securely wrapped around the entire trunk.

**6. Repeat steps 4. and 5. on the other side.**
* Wrap and secure the second strap to the second tree.
_Remember: The height of attachment should match the previous tree._

**7. Clip the carabiner onto the strap.**
* Clip the first carabiner to the loop from the first tree strap.

**8. Repeat on the opposite side.**
* Clip the second carabiner to the loop from the second tree strap.
_Note: Your hammock should be off the ground after this step._

**9. Test the hammock.**
* First, use your hands to test the sturdiness of the hammock set-up.
* If the hammock bears your weight, enter the hammock with one knee. Use your hands for stability as you pull your second knee into the hammock.

**10. Readjust strap height as necessary.**
**IMPORTANT: To prevent serious injury from a fall, the hammock should be no more than 18 inches off the ground with your weight. Reference Image B.**
* Aim for a 30 degree strap angle between the straps and the ground. Reference Image C.

**11. Lie back and relax.**
**CAUTION: Never swing or jump aggresively in the hammock.**
* Crawl into the hammock using step 9.'s knee-first approach.
* Angle your body 10-15 degrees away from the centerline for maximum back support.
